# Unemployment-Rate-Forecasting-Using-ARIMA-and-XGBoost
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting unemployment rates using time series modeling (ARIMA) and machine learning (XGBoost). By leveraging historical unemployment data, we aim to predict future unemployment trends and compare the performance of traditional statistical models against advanced machine learning techniques.
