# Unemployment-Rate-Forecasting-Using-ARIMA-and-XGBoost
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting unemployment rates using time series modeling (ARIMA) and machine learning (XGBoost). By leveraging historical unemployment data, I aim to predict future unemployment trends and compare the performance of traditional statistical models against advanced machine learning techniques.

Project Objectives
1. Analyze historical unemployment trends using time-series visualization.
2. Apply ARIMA modeling to forecast future unemployment rates.
3. Train an XGBoost model using lag-based features to enhance predictions.
4. Compare ARIMA vs. XGBoost and evaluate their forecasting accuracy.
5. Generate an automated report using R Markdown for reproducibility.

Technologies Used
1. Programming Language: R
2. Data Analysis & Processing: tidyverse, lubridate, dplyr
3. Time Series Forecasting: forecast, tseries (ARIMA)
4. Machine Learning: xgboost, caret
5. Data Visualization: ggplot2, autoplot()
6. Reporting: R Markdown (.Rmd), HTML/PDF/Word reports

Methodology
1️. Data Collection & Preprocessing
   - Load the historical unemployment dataset (unemployment.csv).
   - Convert the date column to a proper Date format.
   - Handle missing values and sort data chronologically.
   - Transform data into a time series object.
2️. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualize unemployment trends over time using ggplot2.
   - Check for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
   - Perform seasonal decomposition to analyze trends and seasonality.
3️. Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA)
   - Fit an ARIMA model using auto.arima().
   - Generate a 12-month forecast.
   - Evaluate performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
4️. Machine Learning Forecasting (XGBoost)
   - Engineer lag features (Lag_1, Lag_12) to model temporal dependencies.
   - Train an XGBoost regression model on unemployment data.
   - Predict the next 12 months' unemployment rates.
   - Compare XGBoost predictions vs. ARIMA forecasts.
5️. Forecasting & Evaluation
   - Plot forecasted unemployment rates for the next 12 months.
   - Compare ARIMA and XGBoost forecasts using RMSE & MAE.
   - Interpret findings and suggest improvements for future modeling.
6️. Automated Reporting
   - Generate an R Markdown Report (.Rmd).
   - Knit the report into HTML, PDF, or Word format for sharing.

Key Findings
1. ARIMA performs well for structured, seasonal patterns but struggles with sudden changes.
2. XGBoost captures complex patterns and adapts to economic fluctuations.
3. Hybrid approaches (ARIMA + XGBoost) can improve accuracy.

Project Impact
1. Helps policymakers predict economic trends and prepare for job market shifts.
2. Provides businesses and researchers with reliable unemployment forecasting models.
3. Automates unemployment analysis using R Markdown reports.
